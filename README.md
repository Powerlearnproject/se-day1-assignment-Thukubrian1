# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is a branch of computer science which entails the creation and maintenance
of systems, apps, websites etc to help solve problems and help in our day to day tasks.
**Importance**
1. It makes works easier
2. It helps solve industrial problems
3. It reduces the time used to perform tasks
   
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The creation of Artificial Intelligence
2. The creation of better and easier programming languages.
3. The rise of agile methodoloies.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Define a problem - This is where we identify and gap and find a solution to it.
2. Design - Wireframes and prototypes of the solution are made e.g website, app etc.
3. Develop -This is where is solution is created by coding.
4. Testing - This where we check for bugs and ensure the solution is running per the requirements.
5. Maintenance - This happens after the solution has been created and is in use. Maintenance can be done by updating, upscaling etc.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodology is a linear, sequential approach to software development where the project is divided into distinct, predefined phases e.g
we can have different steps such as design , code etc and we follow the processes in order, the next process can not start if the previous one has 
not been completed. Agile methodoology is an iterative, flexible approach to software development where the project is broken into small, manageable increments (called sprints) e.g We can assign tasks todifferent individuals then after every week(our sprint) they should have completed a certain milestone, here the process can be done together.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software developer - Their role is to create softwares by coding and also to implement designs.
2. Quality Assurance - Thier role is to ensure that the final product meets the required standards.
3. Project manager - The work of a project manager is to ensure that projects are done within the specified timeline, controll the budget of the project,
                      assign roles and to deliver progress to the client.
   

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

The importance of an IDE is that it makes the writting and arrangement of code easier eg Visual Studio Code while the importance of a VCS is that it helps in the managemnt
of the code versions eg Git 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Lack of time management - This can be solved by the use of time management systems to manage time and projects.
2. Communication barrier - This can be solved by ensuring that the relayed information is not ambinguos but clear and consice.
3. Keeping up with technologies - This can be resolved by ensuring that companies give their employees classes on new and advancements
      `                            on the existing technologies.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing - This is where we test individual components or units of code in isolation.
2. Integration testing -This is where we test the interaction between integrated units or components to ensure they work together as expected.
3. System testing - This is where we test the complete and integrated software system to verify it meets the specified requirements.
4. Acceptance testing - This is where we testing is conducted to determine if the system satisfies the business requirements and is ready for delivery.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

It is the creation of inputs to guide AI models' responses.It's crucial for optimizing accuracy, 
relevance, and efficiency in interactions, ensuring desired outputs from AI systems.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt - Generate for me a python code.
Improved prompt - Generate for me a python code that accepts user's input for two numbers and then calculates the sum.
